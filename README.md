Experiments using LLMixtic

- [X] Add more features:
    - [X] Median & standard deviation of distribution
    - [X] Sum of K most probable tokens
    - [X] Mean log deviation (log(mean(X)) - mean(log(X)))
    - [X] Gini impurity
    - [X] Similarity between input and output of each layer
    - [X] Similarity between outputs of layer i and i+1
- [ ] Experiment:
    - [ ] Implement LLM and feature ablation
    - [ ] Try other classifiers
- [ ] Other:
    - [ ] See if only choosing certain subsections of the sequence works too
